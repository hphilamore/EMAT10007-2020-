Amos and I did not address accurate intuitions beyond the casual
statement that judgment heuristics “are quite useful, but sometimes lead to
severe and systematic errors.” We focused on biases, both because we
found them interesting in their own right and because they provided
evidence for the heuristics of judgment. We did not ask ourselves whether
all intuitive judgments under uncertainty are produced by the heuristics we
studied; it is now clear that they are not. In particular, the accurate intuitions
of experts are better explained by the effects of prolonged practice than by
heuristics. We can now draw a richer andigha riche more balanced
picture, in which skill and heuristics are alternative sources of intuitive
judgments and choices.
The psychologist Gary Klein tells the story of a team of firefighters that
entered a house in which the kitchen was on fire. Soon after they started
hosing down the kitchen, the commander heard himself shout, “Let’s get
out of here!” without realizing why. The floor collapsed almost immediately
after the firefighters escaped. Only after the fact did the commander realize
that the fire had been unusually quiet and that his ears had been unusually
hot. Together, these impressions prompted what he called a “sixth sense
of danger.” He had no idea what was wrong, but he knew something was
wrong. It turned out that the heart of the fire had not been in the kitchen but
in the basement beneath where the men had stood.
We have all heard such stories of expert intuition: the chess master who
walks past a street game and announces “White mates in three” without
stopping, or the physician who makes a complex diagnosis after a single
glance at a patient. Expert intuition strikes us as magical, but it is not.
Indeed, each of us performs feats of intuitive expertise many times each
day. Most of us are pitch-perfect in detecting anger in the first word of a
telephone call, recognize as we enter a room that we were the subject of
the conversation, and quickly react to subtle signs that the driver of the car
in the next lane is dangerous. Our everyday intuitive abilities are no less
marvelous than the striking insights of an experienced firefighter or
physician—only more common.

The psychology of accurate intuition involves no magic. Perhaps the
best short statement of it is by the great Herbert Simon, who studied chess
masters and showed that after thousands of hours of practice they come to
see the pieces on the board differently from the rest of us. You can feel
Simon’s impatience with the mythologizing of expert intuition when he
writes: “The situation has provided a cue; this cue has given the expert
access to information stored in memory, and the information provides the
answer. Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than recognition.”
